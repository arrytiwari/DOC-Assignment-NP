# SafeSend Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to SafeSend, your crypto’s seatbelt.
Ever sent tokens to the wrong address and felt your soul leave your body? 😭
We built SafeSend to make sure that never happens again. Confirm every transaction with a tap on Telegram — because double-checking is cheaper than crying.

**Live Platform:** [https://safesend.to/](https://safesend.to/)

## Problem Statement

Traditional cryptocurrency transfers face several critical challenges:

1. **Irreversibility**: Once a transaction is sent to the wrong address, funds are permanently lost
2. **Human Error**: One wrong character, and your ETH is doing a permanent field trip.
3. **Lack of Confirmation**: No “Are you sure?” like Amazon checkout gives you for a $5 toothbrush.
4. **Complex Process**: Managing multiple wallet addresses across different chains is cumbersome
5. **No Testing Mechanism**: Users cannot verify recipient addresses before sending large amounts

SafeSend solves these problems by introducing:
- Two-factor confirmation via Telegram
- Test amount feature to verify recipient addresses
- Address book management
- Multi-chain support with clear chain selection
- Transaction approval system with full user control

---

## Target Audience

SafeSend is designed for:

- **Crypto Beginners**: Users new to blockchain who need additional safety guardrails
- **High-Value Transfer Users**: Anyone sending significant amounts and requiring extra confirmation
- **Frequent Senders**: Users who regularly transfer tokens to multiple addresses
- **Business & Organizations**: Companies making regular crypto payments to employees, vendors, or partners
- **DeFi Users**: Active DeFi participants who transfer tokens across multiple protocols and chains
- **Risk-Averse Individuals**: Anyone who prioritizes security over speed in crypto transactions

## Limitations

### Current Limitations

3. **Transaction Speed**
   - Additional Telegram confirmation step adds 30-60 seconds to transaction time

## Understanding Gas Fees

### What Are Gas Fees?

Gas fees are transaction costs paid to blockchain validators/miners for processing your transaction. These fees are paid in the native token of the blockchain (ETH for Ethereum, BNB for BSC, etc.).

### Fee Structure for SafeSend

SafeSend transactions may require **multiple gas payments**:

1. **Token Approval Transaction** (first time per token)
   - Grants permission to SafeSend contract
   - One-time cost per token per chain
   - Variable based on network congestion

2. **Test Amount Transfer** (if used)
   - Separate transaction for test amount
   - Normal transfer gas cost

3. **Main Transfer Transaction**
   - Primary transfer of tokens
   - Highest gas cost component

### Optimizing Gas Costs

- **Use Arbitrum One**: Significantly lower fees than Ethereum
- **Time Your Transactions**: Send during low network activity
- **Batch Transfers**: Consider multiple recipients if available
- **Monitor Gas Prices**: Use gas trackers to find optimal times

### Estimated Gas Costs (Approximate)

| Network | Approval | Transfer | Total (USD) |
|---------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Ethereum | $5-20 | $8-30 | $13-50+ |
| Arbitrum One | $0.10-0.50 | $0.20-1 | $0.30-1.50 |
| BSC | $0.15-0.50 | $0.25-1 | $0.40-1.50 |

*Note: Prices vary significantly based on network congestion and gas prices*
